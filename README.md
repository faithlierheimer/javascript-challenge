# JavaScript Challenge 
This repository demonstrates my mastery of a few key javascript skills. 
* Building a striped, dynamic HTML table using an external javascript data file and D3 selectors. 
* Adding a filtering button that accepts user-defined input.
* Extracting user-defined input and using it to filter the data table by date, clearing and repopulating the data table each time new input is entered.
* Optimizing code and reducing repetition by using functions to reuse processes.
